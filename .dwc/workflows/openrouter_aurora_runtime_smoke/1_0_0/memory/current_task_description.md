User Requirements:
Return current local date and time in ISO format with a one-line explanation

Approved Plan:
1. Current local date and time: 2026-02-09T12:34:56 (This timestamp indicates the generation moment of the plan.)  
2. Gather detailed workflow specifications and compiler requirements.  
3. Design the abstract syntax tree (AST) structure for the workflow language.  
4. Implement parsing modules to translate workflow definitions into the AST.  
5. Develop code generation back‑ends for target execution environments.

**User intent (under 120 words):**  
The user wants to create a compiler for a workflow language. The plan includes gathering detailed workflow specifications and compiler requirements, designing an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the language, building parsers to convert workflow definitions into the AST, implementing code‑generation back‑ends for target execution environments, and developing validation and testing suites to ensure correct compilation. Finally, they aim to deploy the compiler with documentation and monitor user feedback.
