Parse requirements and lock the current task description in shared memory. 2. Split the task into independent subtasks for tool construction. 3. Build one tool function per subtask via tool-builder agents. 4. Verify each tool in a venv with execution-based integrity checks. 5. Iterate tool fix...\n",
